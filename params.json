{"name":"Lockbook","tagline":"Automate your self-control -- block websites until a specified date (maybe after your finals)","body":"# LockBook\r\n\r\n### Automate your self-control\r\n\r\nBlock access to time-waster sites such as Facebook and Netflix. Unlock on a specific date (maybe when your finals are over).\r\n\r\n### [Download](https://github.com/bgschiller/LockBook/raw/master/LockBook.zip)\r\n\r\n### FAQs\r\n\r\n#### How does it work?\r\n\r\nEven though you access LockBook from a website, the program is running on your own computer. When you set a lock, it updates some settings on your machine so that, eg, 'facebook.com' resolves to an address that doesn't exist.\r\n\r\n#### Is this safe?\r\n\r\nI believe it to be safe. That said, this software is distributed without warranty. Weâ€™re not responsible if this software eats your children, backs over your cat, causes a nuclear meltdown, etc.\r\n\r\n#### What if I change my mind?\r\n\r\nThe software does not provide a way to remove locks. If you do change your mind, any competent software engineer will be able to remove the locks. If you live near me, I'd probably even do it in return for some baked goods, or a 6-pack of beer.\r\n\r\n#### Why does it need my password?\r\n\r\nThe settings we change to place a lock require elevated permissions. Lockbook will not work without your password.\r\n\r\n#### Do I have to keep this program running?\r\n\r\nNo, the block will be in place whether the program is open or not. However, the landing page will only work if LockBook is running. You will also have to run LockBook once your time expires in order to unlock your system.\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-42131022-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
